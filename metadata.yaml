description: '"First published in Boston in 1838, this volume in the American Antiquarian
  Cookbook Collection is a facsimile edition of one of the first American books to
  advocate a vegetarian diet (vegan, actually), by a founding member of the first
  vegetarian organization, the American Vegetarian Society. The dedicated lifestyle
  philosophy advocated in Alcott''s Vegetable Diet might have been written by a contemporary
  vegetarian food critic. Alcott''s complete disdain for meat and all animal products
  consumed as food would, in fact, be called a vegan diet. His book focuses on the
  superiority of a vegetable diet for supporting health and recovering from disease,
  and it contains dozens of letters testifying to that belief by various medical experts
  and many citizens who report in great detail the benefits of the vegetable diet
  for their health and lifestyle"--Amazon.com, viewed December 17, 2012.'
